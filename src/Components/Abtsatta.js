          <h3>What is Satta King?</h3>
          <p>As easy it may seem to speak, as complicated it is. There is a misconception among the people that Satta king is a game. However, it's not.

          <h3>What is Satta Matka?</h3>
          <p>Satta Matka is a number-based lottery game in which your luck and precision help you to win the fortune. Before you guys wonder why it's called Satta Matka let me help unveil the dragon. Earlier, results for the game used to come out of the earthen pot, or "Matka" (another word for earthen pot). As a result of this, the term Matka was added to it.

As prior mentioned, Satta Matka is a number-based game. It is played between 00 and 99. Bettors have to choose numbers between them and place bets on their desired number. Additionally, to make the game more interesting, lottery companies added Jodi and Dhara to the game. People can either predict the combination of numbers or a single number. Meanwhile, if someone did a precise prediction, they win. Furthermore, they receive the winning amount, either 9x or 90x of the waged money, complying with the satta they waged on ( If someone has waged ₹10, then 9x will be 90, and 90x will be 900). Success in Satta Matka is totally luck-based if your fortune is favoring you. You can win loads of money overnight. If you don't, you can lose a big time.

Though everyone plays the game Satta Matka, they have very less idea about the name. Satta King's title became so popular and made its way into the colloquial language. Moreover, people know the game the same. Currently, Satta King is one of the most played lottery games, along with Gali, Disawar, and a few more. Greed and lust for easy money among people made it immense.</p>

          <h3>History of Satta King?</h3>
          <p>The story of the satta king begins prior to independent India. Its history dates back to the 1940s in colonial India. At that point, the Britishers used to import cotton from India via Bombay ports and New York Cotton Exchange used to fix the rate. Daily wage workers from there used to predict the pricing of the cotton trade. As it was their way to kill time, what else did they had back then? Sooner, this prediction game turned into a full-fledged satta.

People started betting money on the cotton price. As they find it quite fascinating, how easy can money be made? The game, which started as time passed, it soon became a business. Few folks who saw the opportunity came up with the idea of this business. They started operating the satta. In a short time, stalls were opened outside of the port to play Satta. Satta was blooming at that very moment. The greed, the need, or the addiction everything helped Satta to boom.

However, with the bliss of easy money, there came the boon. Workers started losing their daily wages over betting. They started getting addicted to the lust for easy money. After losing, they used to play more in chase of loosening money. When New York Cotton Exchange came to know about it, they banned all kinds of betting on cotton trades. Police started raiding the stalls. Operators faced a huge loss due to that. And an era of betting over cotton trades came to an end.

Although, they were unable to ban the betting. Due to lucrative addiction to the game people came out with new ways to gamble. Satta Matka, was one such.

As said above, satta matka is comprised of two words. "Satta" means betting, and "Matka" means earthen pot. All the given numbers are used to put under the earthen pot inside chits. Folks used to predict numbers and bet on the number that will come out of the pot (winning number). This game got so much popularity that it's still alive, till the time we're writing this and you're reading this.

Afterward, in the 1960s, Ankara Jugad (earlier name of satta king) see a huge rise. In 1962, Kalyanji Bhagat, a operator of Satta Matka started it on large scale, and named his lottery Kalyan Matka. It was a huge success. Kalyan Matka became a word-to-mouth name. Kalyanji Bhagat also gained huge popularity and people started calling him The Satta King. It is believed that Kalayanji Bhagat was the creator of Satta Matka. He started the idea of taking chit out of the earthen pot. Later, after seeing the popularity that Kalyan Matka, another bookie Ratan Khatri also started his own game in 1964, New Worli Matka. Tho the idea was same as Kalyan's but he introduced some rules to the game.

Kalyan Matka used to run all day of the week. At the same time, the new worli matka used to run only five days a week. During the 1990s, Satta gained all the name and fame. Daily betting volume was grown up to 500 crores. Gradually, other parts of India also tasted it. It became famous in other parts of India as well. The daily volume of satta was rising every day. In 2000s, satta matka faces the setback. Repetitive police raids damaged the bases of Satta Matka. Continuous interference from the police became a huge issue. Khaiwal started to hide.

Stalls where people used to place bets closed down. Owing to that, the business faced a severe loss. Somehow, they still survived that. Everything went underground. Khaiwals, Bettors, Operators, everyone. No one had any idea where and how they operated. This kept them off the hook for a long time. In 2008, Suresh Bhagat, son of Kalyan Bhagat, was shot dead. After the demise of Suresh Bhagat, it was believed that satta would be shut forever. Irrespective of the hurdles satta has faced it still came back, better than before.

As said in old texts, gambling is in our blood</p>

It was their responsibility to deliver the result and win money for the bettors. However, after the police started intervening, placing bet became tough. Khaiwals went underground. Yet, people found ways to bet.

Furthermore, Leveraging the digital revolution satta also came online. Khaiwals started their own websites, and apps to place bets. Social Media became a junction for bettors. Even the results started to come online. Although satta companies didn't have their own websites still, somehow khaiwals were able the manage it.

There is a lot of website out on the internet that lets you play the satta online. Indeed, playing satta online gives bettors ease. Yet, they prefer the traditional method. In spite of all the boom, the traditional way of playing satta still remain alive. One such reason for that is its audience. Satta King's audience is the lower middle class and lower class, who are still learning about digitalization. People still go to khaiwal. Give them money, and they wage that money on their behalf and take some commission out of it.

Furthermore, after giving the money to the khaiwal, bettors have to give them the predicted number. Single number if they are playing for Dhara and tens if playing for Jodi. Khaiwal will place their bet for them. After the results announce ( every company has fixed its time for the result), khaiwal will receive the money from the lottery company and delivers them to the winners. Khaiwal handles all the headache once the bet is placed.</p>
